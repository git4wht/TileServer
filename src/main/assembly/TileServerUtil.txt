usage: 
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar merge <db-src-directory> <db-destination-directory>
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar extract <db-src-directory> <destination-directory>
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar deletetiles <db-directory> <tile-coordinates> 
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar delete <db-directory> <condition(s)>
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar purge <db-directory>
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar print <db-directory>
	java -jar TileServerUtil.jar empty <db-directory>
	

merge mode: 
	Copies the tiles from the tile store of one map source in the 
	db-src-directory into the tile-store in the db-destination-directory.

extract mode:
	Saves every tile from the tile store database of one map in 
	db-directory as one file in the destination directory. 
	Subdirectories will be created using the following pattern: zoom/x
	The y coordinate is used as file name.

deletetiles mode:
    Allows to specify a number of tiles that will be deleted from the 
    specified database. Each tile is identified by a "tile-coordinate",
    a string of the following form: zoom/x/y
    
    Tile coordinate examples:
    	"8/10/11" -> zoom=8,x=10,y=11

delete mode:
	Deletes all tiles that matches all conditions from the tile store 
	database specified by db-directory. Therefore you can combine any 
	conditions to delete specific tiles from the database.
	
	Condition examples: 
		etag:2ae23d-520c-4b08de03fd680
		zoom:15
		x:2333
		y:4444 

	Note: Deleted tiles do not immediately reduce the used disk space
	of a tile store. To free unused disk space use the "purge" command.   
		
purge mode:
	Clean up the database by freeing unused space.

print mode:
	Prints every tile (it's meta data) from the tile store database in 
	db-directory on the console.

empty mode:
	Create empty an tile store database in
	db-directory on the console.
